# Micro API-based CMS using Node, Express, Mongoose and Passport
Designed to be used add "updatability" to mostly-static sites
## What does it do?
It is a simple CRUD API with authentication. Currently, it has two endpoints, users and events. Users are used for authentication, and events are an object containing a 'start_time', a 'name' and a 'description'
## Why?
For adding the ability to update some sections for client sites. This is also a learning project, as it is my first non-trivial project with NodeJS.
